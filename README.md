# Project Caesar Cipher
This project was created as a learning exercise during the Forma√ß√£o.DEV course.

It is a simplified implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher**, focusing only on the **encryption process**.  

The application allows users to enter a message and shift value, generating the encrypted text based on the Caesar Cipher technique.

The main goal of this project was to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** by building a small, interactive web application.

## ü§î What is this project
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.  
In this project, I implemented only the **encryption** feature, where each letter of the input text is shifted by a given number of positions in the alphabet. 

## üñ•Ô∏è How to run the project
